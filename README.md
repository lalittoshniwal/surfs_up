# Surfs_up

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to study the weather pattern of a Hawaiian Island - Oahu, and determine whether it will support a surf and ice-cream shop. In this particular challenge, I studied the temperature trends during the months of June and December to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results: 
-- the average temperature during the month of June is 74.94 with standard deviation of 3.25
-- the average temperature during the month of December is 71.04 with standard deviation of 3.74
-- the 25th percentile of the temperature is 73 and 69 during the months of June and December respectively

## Summary: 
Based on the analysis, the island of Oahu is an ideal location to start a surf and ice-cream shop. The temperature seldomly drops below 69 degrees even during the months of December. To further support my conclusion, I would like to run following queries:
    - average precipitation and 75th percentile precipitation values during the month of June
    - average precipitation and 75th percentile precipitation values during the month of December
